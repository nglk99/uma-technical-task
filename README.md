### How to Use:

This shader's properties are divided in multiple sections for easier access: **Tint Colors**, **Textures**, **Geometry Values**, **Grass Values** and **Level of Detail**.

In the **Tint Colors** section, the user is able to pick their desired tint, the shadow color and the saturation of the grass.

Under the **Textures** section, it is possible to tweak the main texture of the material, along with the grass pattern, noise and wind distortion textures. Here one can pick the tile of the main texture.

The **Geometry Values** section contains the displacement settings, the minimum and amount of grass displacement, as well as the offset by normal or offset by direction vector.

**Grass Values** is the section with additional settings such as wind speed and direction, grass thinness and noise power. This section offers three more tiling methods.

Finally, the **Level of Detail** section contains the direction at which the shader effects start to fade.
